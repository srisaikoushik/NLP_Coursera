# NLP_Coursera
This repository holds the project files from the Coursera course Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces.

## Week 1
Week 1 activities include learning how to extract features for logistic regression from a text input, implementing logistic regression 
from scratch, applying logistic regression to a task involving natural language processing, testing our logistic regression, and performing 
error analysis.

## Week 2
Week 2 tasks include learning how to train a naive bayes model for a sentiment analysis task, testing the model, computing the ratio of positive
to negative words, performing error analysis, and making predictions about our own tweets.

## Week 3
In Week 3, we'll predict word analogies, use PCA to make the word embeddings less dimensional and plot them in two dimensions, compare word embeddings
using a similarity metric (the cosine similarity), and comprehend how these vector space models function.

## Week 4
In week 4, we'llÂ Analyze the word embeddings for words in English and French; embeddings are translated as linearly transformed, The translation, LSH, 
and document search are being tested. Getting the embeddings for the documents, Finding the tweets that are most similar to LSH by searching the tweets 
and finding a vector's hash number.
